Our team's main objective is to create a software named Assignment Due that can assign and delete group tasks supporting multi-users. The software is pretty similar to the To-Do list apps that can be download from the App Store some other online app stores, with additional multiuser features and task attributes.

To run the program, you must have Python 3 installed on your computer, and run either command.py or gui.py to enter the user interface. The command.py is a command line version interface and the gui.py is graphic user interface.
